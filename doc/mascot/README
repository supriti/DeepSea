This is a silly little DeepSea mascot.  It's completely wrong, of
course, because the picture conveys the impression that ceph is
managing (or possibly eating) salt, but I couldn't resist...

* mascot-scan.jpg is a slightly touched up version of the original
  hand drawn image.
* mascot.svg was traced from the above, and tweaked a bit (the
  outer tentacles were moved slightly).
* mascot.png was generated from the SVG.
